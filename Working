# Original Code from http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2013/01/Adding-an-On-Off-switch-to-your-Raspberry-Pi/(offset)
# My plan is to modify it to include additional capabilities
# One capability is to control an LED based on https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/hardware/rgb-led-gpio
# My board includes a reset button (connected to the "run" header), a safe shutdown button (see comment 1), and an LED to monitor the PI

# Import the modules to send commands to the system and access GPIO pins
from subprocess import call
import RPi.GPIO as gpio

# Define a function to keep script running
def loop():
    raw_input()
 
# Define a function to run when an interrupt is called
def shutdown(pin):
     call('halt', shell=False)

 gpio.setmode(gpio.BOARD) # Set pin numbering to board numbering
 gpio.setup(7, gpio.IN) # Set up pin 7 as an input
 gpio.add_event_detect(7, gpio.RISING, callback=shutdown, bouncetime=200) # Set up an interrupt to look for button presses

 loop() # Run the loop function to keep script running
